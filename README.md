# Two Tier Node Application


Building a two-tier Node.js application and deploying it with a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, Multistage Docker Image, Docker Compose, and GitHub Webhooks involves:

**Setup:** Organize the project with frontend and backend tiers.

**CI/CD Pipeline:** Use Jenkins for automation, triggering jobs with GitHub Webhooks.

**Code Quality:** Integrate SonarQube for static code analysis.

**Containerization:** Dockerize the application for consistency and portability.

**Multistage Docker:** Optimize Docker images for production.

**Deployment:** Define services with Docker Compose for deployment.

**Testing:** Implement automated tests at each stage of the pipeline.

**Monitoring:** Integrate monitoring and logging solutions for real-time insights.

**Documentation:** Document the pipeline setup and deployment process for collaboration and knowledge sharing.
